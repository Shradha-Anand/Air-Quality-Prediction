# Air Quality Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict air quality based on environmental and meteorological data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple regression and classification models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of predictions and feature importances

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available air quality datasets containing features such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, CO)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git
    cd air-quality-prediction
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/` — Source code for data processing and model training
- `main.py` — Entry point for training and evaluation

## Results

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R². Visualizations help interpret model predictions and feature impacts.
